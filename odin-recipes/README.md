# Odin-Project/odin-recipes

Hey there! This is a task I did as a part of the Odin Project to help me learn web dev.

This small project will be a way for me to apply the things I have learned so far about HTML (and I will later use it to learn CSS too). It will consist of a main index page with links to a few recipes.

Through this project I will apply the HTML tags and git etiquette that I have learned so far. Best of luck to me.
