<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- LINKS -->
<!-- 
    We can link to other pages in html by using the <a></a> tags 

    href="" is an atribute that defines which page will be linked to

    target="_self" will open the page in the tab we currently are in
    target="_blank" will open the page in another tab

    A little bit of cybersec!!!

    rel="noopener noreferrer" does two things:
    1) prevents page we linked to from knowing we have a link to their page (noreferrer atribute)
    2) prevents page we linked to from making changes to our page (noopener atribute)
        This last property is important to prevent TABNABBING -> a pishing attack that changes our page to one similar
        so that we give away our credentials/other things

-->

<!-- IMAGES -->
<!-- 
    <img src="" alt="">
    
    The src atribute is how we define what image will be loaded (can use relative or absolute links)

    The alt atribute is a text embedded with the image in case it doesnt load/for screen scanners
